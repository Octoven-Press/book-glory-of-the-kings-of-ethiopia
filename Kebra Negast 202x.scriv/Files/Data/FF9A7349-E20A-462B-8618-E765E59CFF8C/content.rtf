\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 And after him, Jacob\'92s firstborn son broke the commandment of God, and the kingdom departed from him and from his descendants, because he had defiled his father\'92s {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://B9EEA863-B095-4467-B104-F3F2491A9744"}}{\fldrslt wife}}; now it is not right to break the law which God has commanded. And his father cursed him, and God was angry with him, and he became the least among his brothers, and his children became leprous and scabby; and although he was the firstborn son of Jacob the kingdom was torn from him{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://600C6128-8750-423C-BF59-886D45471A36"}}{\fldrslt .}} And his younger brother reigned, and he was called Judah because of this{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://D9DF6438-A857-4A09-8236-26C6C9D60A3F"}}{\fldrslt .}} And his descendant was blessed, and his kingdom flourished, and his sons were blessed. And after him Perez his son reigned. And he died and Hezron his son reigned. And after him his son {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://3CA45EA6-CDD3-427D-A952-96D58E366E62"}}{\fldrslt Oren reigned}}, and after him {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://1D70A5F6-8C47-436D-A5FD-AFC90AAF745C"}}{\fldrslt Aram his son reigned}}, and after him Amminadab his son reigned, and after him Nahshon his son reigned, and after him Salmon his son reigned, and after him Boaz his son reigned, and after him Obed his son reigned, and after him Jesse his son reigned. And this is what I say concerning the kingdom: The blessing of the father was on the son, so that the kingdom was blessed with prosperity. And as for the kingship over Israel, after the death of Jesse, David reigned in righteousness, integrity, and graciousness.
