### [_The Glory of the Kings of Ethiopia_](https://github.com/Octoven-Press/book-glory-of-the-kings-of-ethiopia/) is a modernization of the ancient Ethiopian text: the _Kəbrä Nägäśt_ (also known as _The Queen of Sheba and her only son Menyelek I_).

It is a collection of 117 chapters (each clearly authored at various points in time) outlining why Ethiopian emperors are divinely ordained to rule. The narrative centers on the Queen of Sheba’s journey to Jerusalem to meet Judah’s King Solomon, their resulting son Menelik, his subsequent transfer of the Ark of the Covenant back to Ethiopia whereupon he becomes king, and various stories outlining the country’s shift to Christianity afterwards (amongst other narratives). The oldest known copy sits in the [Bibliothèque nationale de France](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10088409f), which was translated to German in 1905 by Carl Bezold. In 1922, Sir E.A. Wallis Budge of the British Museum translated the work to English, with a subsequent edition released in 1932.

This modernization is based on the 1922 work, updating the Elizabethan-style language to an English more easily understood by a modern English reader and augmenting each chapter with new illustrations. 

This project features a number of expected artifacts:
