The following are textual changes that should be made to the Sacred-Texts.com copy of the open-source 1922 version of the Kebra Nagast hosted at https://sacred-texts.com/afr/kn/ — These changes were discovered during a comparison of a modern OCR on the original book, compared with the sacred-texts.com version, and then cross-referenced against the original book to ensure accuracy. 

The changes are organized by unique URLs from the Sacred-Texts.com copy of the text, followed by transcribed print version’s page number, followed by row items of discrete changes required to match the sacred-texts.com version to the 1922 original book. Changes that include instruction beyond typographic change or detailed location (e.g. in a footnote) are prefaced with double exclamation marks (i.e. "!!").
