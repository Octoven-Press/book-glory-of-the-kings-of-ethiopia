\f0\fs24 \cf0 Budge translated this as \'93It shall assuredly not disappear,\'94 but other translations strongly disagree (including Carl Bezold\'92s German translation, which Budge\'92s work is based on, which translated as \'93No, it will disappear.\'94 This replacement line is taken from Gerard Colin\'92s 2002 French translation.}]]></Comment>
