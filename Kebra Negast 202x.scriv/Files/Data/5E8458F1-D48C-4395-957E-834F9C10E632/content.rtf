\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 And that accursed man Cain, the murderer of his brother, multiplied evil, and his descendants did likewise, and they provoked God to anger with their wickedness. They did not have the fear of God before their eyes, never kept in mind that He had created them, never prayed to Him, never worshiped Him, never called upon Him, and never rendered service to Him in fear; no, they ate, drank, danced, played upon stringed instruments, sang lewd songs there, and worked uncleanness without law, without measure, and without rule.

And as for those who do this wickedness, their judgment is ready, and their error is lasting.
