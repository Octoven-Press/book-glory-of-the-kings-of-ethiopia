And Menyelek went out from the house of the Lord, and they called his name David (II), for the name of a king came to him by the law. And they made him to ride upon the mule of King Solomon, and they led him round about the city, and said, \'93We have appointed you from this moment;\'94 and then they cried out to him, \'93B\'e2\uc0\u7717  long live the royal father!\'94 And there were some who said, \'93It is suitable and right that your dominion of Ethiopia shall be from the River of Egypt to the setting sun; blessed be your descendants upon the earth! \'97 and from Shoa to the east of India, for you will please the people of these lands.

And all your enemies and foes shall be overthrown before you, and completion and finish shall be to you and to your descendants after you; you shall judge many nations and none shall judge you.\'94 And again his father blessed him and said to him, \'93The blessing of heaven and earth shall be your blessing,\'94 and all the congregation of Israel said, \'93Amen.\'94 And his father also said to Zadok the priest, \'93Make him to know and tell him concerning the judgment and decree of God which he shall observe there in Ethiopia.\'94
