Now they had divided the earth among them, and Noah had made them swear by the Name of his God that they would not encroach on each other\'92s boundaries, and would not eat the beast that had died of itself or had been rent [by wild animals], and that they would not cultivate harlotry against the law, lest God should again become angry with them and punish them with a Flood. And as for Noah, he humbled himself, and offered up sacrifice, and he cried out, and groaned, and wept. And God held converse with Noah, who said [unto Him], \'93If Thou wilt destroy the earth a second time with a Flood, blot Thou me out with those who are to perish.\'94 And God said unto him, \'93I will make a covenant with thee that thou shalt tell thy children they shall not eat the beast that hath died of itself or that hath been torn by wild beasts, and they shall not cultivate harlotry against the law; and I, on My part, [covenant] that I will not destroy the earth a second time with a Flood, and that I will give unto thy children Winter and Summer, Seedtime and Harvest, Autumn and Spring.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://18B43CDA-6BD1-4761-BCC4-109A233DFBB3"}}{\fldrslt \'94
