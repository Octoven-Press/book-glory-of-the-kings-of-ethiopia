## 5. Concerning the Kingdom of Seth ##

And Adam died, and Seth reigned in righteousness. And Seth died, and Hênôs (Enos) reigned. And Hênôs (Enos) died, and Ḳâynân (Cainan) reigned. And Ḳâynân (Cainan) died, and Malâl’êl (Mahalaleel) reigned. And Malâl’êl (Mahalaleel) died, and Yârôd (Jared) reigned. And Yârôd died, and Hênôkh (Enoch) reigned in righteousness, and he feared God, and [God] hid him so that he might not see death. And he became a king in his flesh in the Land of the Living. And after Enoch disappeared Mâtûsâlâ (Methuselah) reigned. And Mâtûsâlâ died, and Lâmêkh (Lamech) reigned. And Lâmêkh died, and Nôḥ (Noah) reigned in righteousness, and he pleased God in all his works.
