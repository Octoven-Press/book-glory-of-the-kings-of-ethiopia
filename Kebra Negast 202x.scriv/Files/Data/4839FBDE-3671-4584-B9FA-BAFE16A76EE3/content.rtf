\f0\fs26 \cf0 And therefore the children of Ishmael became kings over Tereb, \uc0\u7730 ebe\u7789 , N\'f4b\'e2, S\'f4ba, Kuergue, K\'eef\'ee, M\'e2k\'e2, M\'f4rn\'e2, F\'een\u7731 \'e2n\'e2, \'92Ars\'eeb\'e2n\'e2, L\'eeb\'e2, and Mase\u8219 a, for they were the seed of Shem. And Isaac reigned over Judah, \'92Am\'f4r\'eaw\'f4n, K\'ea\u7789 \'eaw\'f4n, \'92\'cey\'e2b\'fbs\'eaw\'f4n, F\'earz\'eaw\'f4n, \'92E\'eaw\'eaw\'f4n, K\'ea\u7731 \'ead\'eaw\'f4n, R\'f4my\'e2, Antiochia, Syria, Armenia, Palestine, Ethiopia, Edom, Philistia, \'cey\'f4\'e2b, Amalek, Phrygia, Babylon, Y\'f4n\'e2nes\u7789 , and \'92Ebr\'e2yast. For as God swore He gave all kingdoms, an exalted throne, and dominion to the descendants of Shem, even as his father Noah, by the word of God, blessed his son Shem, saying, \'93Be lord to your brothers and reign over them.\'94 And this that he said had reference to the Redeemer, the King of us all, Jesus Christ the King of heaven and earth, Who magnifies kings, and Who when He pleases rescinds their power; for to Him belong power and dominion over all created things forever and ever. Amen.}
