\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 The king of Medy\'e2m was of the descendants of Shem. For of the descendant of Isaac was Esau, who went forth from his mother\'92s womb with Jacob clinging to the sole of his foot; and Jacob carried away the right of the firstborn from Esau for the sake of a mess of stew. And the name of Esau\'92s kingdom was called, according to his name of contempt, \'93Edom,\'94 for the interpretation of \'93Edom\'94 is \'93lentils;\'94 and because of this the descendants of Esau were called \'93Edomites.\'94 For through the greed of his belly he abandoned and lost the right of the firstborn of the descendant of Shem. For unless the soul be restrained by temperance, it will bring down into a net the whole of the lust of the belly which is of the body. For the body is greedy, but temperance restrains the soul, and therefore Paul said, \'93That which the soul does not wish, the body wishes; and that which the body does not wish, the soul wishes, and each contends against the other.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://30D6F686-D0A9-46B6-9B80-4D9EAB3F2C34"}}{\fldrslt \'94}} If a man wills a thing, and his soul bands itself with the desire of his body he becomes like the Devil; but if he restrains his body, and his soul bands itself with his desire he becomes like Christ. For the Apostles say that Christ is the Head of every man who travels upon the straight road. And our Lord said to His disciples, \'93Walk in the Spirit, and perform not the lust of your bodies.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://22195396-1BD0-4A75-A35F-92356959AB94"}}{\fldrslt \'94}} And when they heard this they abandoned all the lust of the flesh, and they said to our Lord, \'93Behold now, we have abandoned everything and followed You; what is our reward?\'94 And our Savior said to them, \'93You have made your bodies like those of the angels, and shall do mighty deeds even as do I. And behold, I have given you authority to raise the dead, and I have given you power to heal the sick, and you shall trample upon all the power of the Enemy. And at My second coming you shall judge and shall put to shame the Twelve Tribes of Israel, because they have not believed on Me, and have treated My glory with contempt. And as for those who believe in Me, you shall magnify them and shall make them to rejoice with you in My kingdom.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://B374851D-95B5-4822-A66E-F9488BEB2510"}}{\fldrslt \'94
