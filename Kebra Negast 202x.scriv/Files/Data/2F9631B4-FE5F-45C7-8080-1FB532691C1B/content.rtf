\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 Now Noah was a righteous man. He feared God, and kept the righteousness and the Law which his fathers had declared to him \'97 now Noah was the tenth generation from Adam \'97 and he kept in remembrance and did what was good, and he preserved his body from sex outside of marriage, and he admonished his children, bidding them not to mingle with the children of Cain, the arrogant usurper, the divider of the kingdom, who walked in the counsel of the Devil, who make evil to flourish. And he taught them everything that God hated \'97 pride, boastfulness of speech, self-adulation, defamation, false accusation, and the swearing of false oaths. And besides these things, in the wickedness of their uncleanness, which was unlawful and against rule, man worked pollution with man, and woman worked with woman the abominable thing.
