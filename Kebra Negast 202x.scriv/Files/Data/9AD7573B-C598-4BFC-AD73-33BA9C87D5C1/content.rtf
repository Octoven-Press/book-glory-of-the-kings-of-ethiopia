\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 And how this Queen was born I have discovered written in that manuscript, and in this manner also does the Evangelist mention her. And our Lord Jesus Christ, in condemning the Jewish people, the crucifiers, who lived at that time, spoke, saying: \'93The Queen of the South shall rise up on the Day of Judgment and shall dispute with, condemn, and overcome this generation who would not listen to the preaching of My word, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://497F80E7-EE96-4768-A966-DB8BC97FE9DE"}}{\fldrslt \'94}} And the Queen of the South of whom He spoke was the Queen of Ethiopia. And in the words \'93ends of the earth\'94 He makes allusion to the delicacy of the constitution of women, the long distance of the journey, the burning heat of the sun, the hunger on the way, and the thirst for water. And this Queen of the South had a very beautiful face, her stature was superb, and her understanding and intelligence, which God had given her, were of such high character that she went to Jerusalem to hear the wisdom of Solomon; now this was done by the command of God and it was His good pleasure. And further, she was exceedingly rich, for God had given her glory, riches, gold, silver, splendid apparel, camels, slaves, and merchants. And they carried on her business and trafficked for her by sea and by land, and in India, and in Aswan.
