# 106. A Prophecy concerning the Coming of Christ

And now hearken how each one of them hath prophesied concerning Him, [for the narrative] is pleasant to hear. Isaiah the Prophet prophesied concerning His coming and said, " A Son is born unto us. A Child is given unto us. Dominion is written upon His shoulder. He is God, strong in rule, King, great Counsellor is His name.”[^fn183] Now the meaning of this is manifest: the Son of God is born, Whose sovereignty was written down before the world was, and He is wiser than anyone else: [this is what] he saith unto thee. And again Isaiah prophesied and said, “Behold My servant Whom I have chosen, on Whom is the delight of My soul, and the nations shall put their confidence in Him.”[^fn184] And these words give us to understand that Christ is the Spirit of God, the Word of the Father Who put on our flesh and was born for us: and the peoples of Rômê and Ethiopia and all other nations have believed in Him. And he spake unto the people of Israel, and again he prophesied, saying, “Many shall follow after Thee with their loins girded up, and their backs bound with fetters, and they shall pray to Thee and worship Thee, for thou art God, and we have not recognized Thee.”[^fn185] Now this he spake concerning the martyrs, and those who became monks in the desert and solitary monks, whose hearts were fettered with His commandment, and who prayed to Him, meaning that reward was meet for both the martyrs and the solitary monks. “And we did not recognize Thee”: Israel made itself blind, and crucified Him, and refused to walk in His righteousness. And again Isaiah prophesied and said, “God shall come, and the heathen shall put their trust in Him and shall know Him;”[^fn186] this meaneth that Christ shall come, and the Jews shall reject Him, but the heathen shall believe in Him. And again he prophesied and said, “Be strong ye weak hands and tired knees, and rejoice ye hearts that are cast down, for God hath come, Who shall requite our debt, and save us. And He shall open the eyes of the blind, and He shall make the ears of the deaf to hear, and the feet that are lame shall run, and the tongues of the dumb shall speak.”[^fn187] These words are spoken in respect of those who err in worshipping idols, and those who are dead in sin, and those whose hearts are darkened, and of you who do not know that God created you. Rejoice ye this day: He hath come Who will redeem the sin of Adam, and make Adam’s debt His own. He was crucified being sinless. He hath killed Death by means of His own death, and the blind see, and the lame walk, and the deaf hear, and the dumb speak unhaltingly, and besides all these things the dead are raised. This is the meaning of this prophecy.

I will come and I will dwell with you, and the nations shall put their trust in My light; for the nations shall be the loved ones of Christ.”

Thus David the Prophet said, “A people whom I do not know shall serve Me; at the mere hearing of the ear they shall answer Me.”[^fn219] And to the Jews he said, “The children of the stranger have been false to me, the children of the stranger have become old and have travelled haltingly on their path. God liveth, and blessed [is] my God.”[^fn220] When he saith unto thee, “God liveth,” he speaketh of His Godhead, and when he saith unto thee “and blessed [is] my God,” he speaketh concerning His putting on the flesh. And again he speaketh concerning His putting on the flesh in Isaiah the Prophet, saying, “Who is this glorious One who cometh forth from Edom, Adônâi, Who came down from heaven, and put on the things of Basôr, glorious in majesty?”[^fn221] When he saith “glorious” he refereth to His sweet odour; and when he saith “Adônâi,” he meaneth the Word of the Father Who was before the world, the Son of God; when he saith “He put on the things of Basôr, the glorious in majesty,” he indicateth clearly the body of Adam.

Thus David the Prophet prophesied saying concerning Christian folk, “Declare ye to the nations that God is King, and that He hath made fast the world so that it shall never be moved.”[^fn222] And he also prophesied concerning His coming to the nations, and said, “Before the face of God shall He come, He shall come and shall judge the earth, and He shall judge the world in righteousness, and the nations with justice.”[^fn223]

Thus his father David prophesied and said, “His name was before the sun, and before the moon, generation to generation.”[^fn229]

Thus his son Solomon prophesied and said, “When He made strong the firmament above the clouds, and when He set in position the walls of the boundaries of the heavens, and when He set the sea in its appointed place, and before He founded His throne above the winds, and when He made strong the foundations of the earth, I existed conjointly with Him. I was that wherein He rejoiced continually, and day by day, and I exulted with Him at all times before His face.”[^fn230]

For I have given water in the desert, and made streams of water to flow in the wilderness, so that I may give drink to My people and to My chosen ones whom I have gotten, so that they may declare My glory, and perform My commandment.”[^fn232]

Thus Solomon prophesied and said, “Who hath gone up into heaven and come down? And who hath gathered together the winds in his bosom? And who hath collected the waters in his garment? And who hath measured the waters of the sea in his hand, and the heavens on the palm of his hand? And what is his name and what is the name of his son?”[^fn233]

Thus Micah the Prophet prophesied and said unto the Jews, “I have no pleasure in you, saith God Who ruleth all things. And I have no pleasure in your offerings, and I will accept no gift from your hands. For from the rising of the sun to the setting thereof shall My Name be praised among all peoples, and in all countries incense shall be offered up to my great Name among all peoples, saith Almighty God.”[^fn234]

And again Micah the Prophet said, “A new covenant shall appear upon the mountain of God, and it shall be prepared upon the tops of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills, and people shall say, ‘Come ye, let us go up into the mountain of God.’ And many nations shall go thereto and shall say, ‘Come ye, let us go up into the mountain of God,[^fn235] and they shall declare unto us His way, and we will walk therein.’”

And to Him be praise for ever and ever! Amen.
