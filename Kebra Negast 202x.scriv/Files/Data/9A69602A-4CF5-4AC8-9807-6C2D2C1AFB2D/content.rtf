\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 And the Tabernacle of the Law of God, the Holy Zion, shall remain here until that day when our Lord shall dwell on Mount Zion; and Zion shall come and shall appear to all prepared, with three seals \'97 even as Moses gave her \'97 as it says in the Old Law and in the New, \'93At the testimony of two or three witnesses everything shall stand.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://F4705A10-EEB4-4489-975B-B16A16920D73"}}{\fldrslt \'94}} And then, said Isaiah the Prophet, \'93The dead shall be raised up, and those who are in the graves shall live, for the dew which comes from You is their life.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://15234041-EB3A-4895-AF6B-694EE81E0B4F"}}{\fldrslt \'94}} And when the dead are raised up, His mercy by which He waters the earth shall cease; they shall stand up before Him with the works which they have done. And Enoch and Elias shall come, being alive, so that they may testify, and Moses and Aaron from the dead shall live with everyone. And they shall open the things that fetter Zion, and they shall make to be seen the Jews, the crucifiers, and they shall punish them and chide them because of all that they have done in perverting the Word of God. And the Jews shall see what He wrote for them with His hand \'97 the Words of His Commandment, and the manna with which He fed them without toil on their part, and the measure of it; the G\'f4m\'f4r, and the spiritual Zion, which came down for their salvation, and the rod of Aaron, which blossomed after the manner of Mary.
