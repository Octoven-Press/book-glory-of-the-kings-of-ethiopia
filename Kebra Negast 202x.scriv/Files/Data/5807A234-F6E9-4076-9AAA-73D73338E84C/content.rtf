\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 And it came to pass that when the elder daughter of Lot had brought forth her son, she said to the younger daughter, \'93Come now, let us make our father drink wine, so that you also may have sex with him that, perhaps, you may become pregnant.\'94 And again they prepared wine, and again they spoke to him the words of foolishness, and said to him, \'93Drink wine, Oh our father, so that your heart may be comforted;\'94 and he, the simple man, drank and became drunk. And again, when he had drunk and his mind was clouded with wine, the younger daughter came and had sex with him, and again he did not know of her having sex with him, or of her rising up from him. And she also conceived and gave birth to a son, and she called his name \'93Ammon,\'94 and he is the father of the Amalekites. Behold now, it is clear that the King of Amalek is of the descendants of Shem.
